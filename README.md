# TaskSaver

TaskSaver is a desktop application that allows you to save and reopen currently active applications. It utilizes `PyQt5` for the graphical user interface and `psutil` to gather process information.

## Features

- **Save Active Applications**: Save the currently open applications with visible windows.
- **Reopen Applications**: Launch saved applications if they are not already open.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Windows operating system (as it uses Windows-specific libraries)

## Recommended Setup

It may be beneficial to add this script to your system's startup routine so that it can automatically restore your applications when your computer boots.
